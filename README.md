# uMove - University of Movement
## Project Description
This project was created as our California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) Senior Project from January-December 2019. Our goal is to have an application where students of movement can come and have a safe place where they can not only see their movement, but receive corrections as well. Through the use of artificial intelligence and a good architectual framework, we'll be able to start the foundation for a school that empowers its students to become the teachers; with the promise that we will be constantly learning right alongside you.
