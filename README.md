# pose-estimation

## Welcome to our senior project!

### - Our app is designed for easy user access to really cool neural networks created by Google. The user will be able to take a picture with their smartphone and have the neural network analyze that picture and return the body points for the given picture. We're able to store this data in an effective database and use that data for future diagnostics of form issues. The user will soon have a "coach on demand" right in their own pockets for any kind of movement they have the desire to learn.
